Code used for the NYU Tandon EG-1004 Semester Long Design Project (SLDP)
Our prototype uses the MAX300102 oximeter and MLX90614 IR sensor to measure the bpm, spo2, glucose, and temperature of the patient. 

The code for the MAX300102 sensor was based on [user eminemirhansener's repo]([url](https://github.com/eminemirhansener/Arduino-Based-Non-Invasive-Glucometer?tab=readme-ov-file)).
